            <h2>Passion For Tech</h2>
            <p>I am definitely a computer nerd. I had an old desktop machine when I was very young, I saved up to buy my first laptop with birthday & Christmas money in 3rd grade, and my first powerful gaming laptop in 9th grade. I love all things information technology (IT). In High School, I had the opportunity to join the Information Technology & Software Engineering block program: a 2-hour a day class that dabbled in pretty much every area of IT. Topics such as programming, security, networking, software, hardware, operatting systems, etc.</p>

            <p>My love for computers continued throughout my college career, in which I was able to complete dozens of projects spanning across the broad field of <em>Computer Science</em>. A couple of the later projects can be seen on my <a href="https://github.com/JPEG1" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, although I am far more proud of the work I've done professionally than the simple projects completed for school.</p>

            <h2>Professional Experience Pre-Graduation</h2>
            <p>At the University of Cincinnati, the Computer Science degree follows the 5-year <abbr title="College of Engineering and Appliced Science">CEAS</abbr> program's structure, which required us to take five professional Co-Op semesters. This gave me the opportunity to obtain five entire semesters of real-world, professional work experience before I graduate. Consequently, this is how I kickstarted my professional career. I've outlined my professional experience in more detail on the corresponding page of this portfolio.</p>

            <h2>Faith</h2>
            <p>I've been a Christian for most of my life. Throughout college, I got involved with a ministy called The Salt Company, whom is part of a larger <a href="https://www.thesaltnetwork.com/" target="_blank">Salt Network</a>. The Salt Network has planted dozens of churches & college ministries on major universities across the U.S. I have a particular heart for college students—being one myself at the time of writing this—and am excited to be helping plant a new church & ministry in Denton, TX (north of Dallas).</p>

            <h2>Extracurriculars & Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I <strong>love</strong> soccer. I played soccer for over 11 years and I've followed professional teams since 2008. One of the top items on my bucket list is to go an watch my favorite football (soccer) club, Chelsea FC play in person at home, in London. After I got out of soccer, I ran track for a few years and then ultimately shifted to lifting. I'm also an avid gamer. While I don't play any videogames competitively as of right now, name a game and I've probably played it. Over the years I've traversed all different genres of games and built & led entire communities of >3000 players. I'm always down to talk about gaming news, or sit down and hop online with some friends for a nice chill night.</p>
