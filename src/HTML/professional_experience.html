            <h2>Professional</h2>
            <p>The bulk of my professional experience thus far has been with Performance Electronics, Ltd. They're an embedded systems company which produces performance, aftermarket drag car products. Products such as ethanol sensors and engine control units for drag cars are among the many things they produce. My formal title was <em>Mobile Application Developer Co-Op</em>; but, the company was very small, which means I worked in all sectors of the development process. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there, and drastically increased the breadth of my knowledge, delving into embedded development, enterprise systems, mobile & desktop apps, and more.</p>

            <p>As mentioned above, while my official title was <em>Mobile Application Developer Co-Op</em>, I quickly took on much more responsibility within the company. Within 2 years, I was leading the entire mobile app & enterprise systems (API's, databases, & cloud-based systems) departments. I facilitated official Android & iOS app releases, the publishing of new features to our REST API's, & updates to our Azure database(s).</p>

            <p>Below, I've linked a couple of the published Android/iOS apps which I've worked on or built entirely myself while at Performance Electronics, Ltd.</p>

            <h2>Miscellaneous Projects</h2>
            <p>I've also worked on dozens of other miscellaneous projects, some spanning multiple months. The descriptions offered below are a bit wordy, but hopefully provide a more thorough understanding of the breadth of my professional experience.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Android Mobile UI Espresso Testing & DFU Testing</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>As I worked my way up towards leading development of PE's mobile apps, I was tasked with setting up automated UI testing using the <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso">Android Espresso framework</a>. I tested a variety of different things; however, one of the most key components I tested was the Device Firmware Update (DFU) process which I developed. More detailed information on that can be found <a href="../HTML/design_and_development.html">here</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Small Enclosure Production Test Fixture (SEPTF)</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>At PE, many of the devices we built fit into one of our 3 main <em>form factors</em> (or enclosures). Thus, we could setup a programming & testing procedure specific to the enclosure, which could work across any number of projects in the same enclosure. This project originally began under one of our co-op's (university students). After aiding in development until the end of their co-op term, I picked up the project and massively expanded it. It ultimately ended up being the software which our production group used during various production cycles.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Dataverse</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Without getting into the nitty gritty of how our modules functioned, we needed to design the RAM database entries & generate .c & .h source code files dynamically. <em>The Dataverse</em> was a localized, C# <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/overview/?view=netdesktop-9.0" target="_blank">Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)</a> desktop application I developed to allow for such management. It would load in .c & .h files into a neat data table for easy modification, allow for creation of new files from scratch or from templates we created, perform validation on Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) pages to ensure no memory page overflows, see various NVM diagnostics, and a whole bunch more. It could be classified as an internal tool to aid development, not released to the public.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Computer Vision</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>My first real project with PE in 2021 was an exploratory, proof-of-concept idea for setting up automated testing & validation of our PE dash displays. The general idea behind this project was to setup a camera pointed at our PE dash displays, and then trigger the startup sequence. After starting up, we'd also manually inject data over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus" target="_blank">Controller Area Network (CAN) bus</a>. to display test values and confirm them via the camera. To complete this, I implemented my solution using a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi 4</a> & the <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/index.html" target="_blank">OpenCV Python library</a>. This project was a great introduction into the world of testing & validation. It also gave me a much more thorough understanding of how both hardware & software need to be considered when designing & implementing solutions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>CAN Projects</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>All</em> of our modules at PE communicated over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus" target="_blank">Controller Area Network (CAN) bus</a>. Consequently, I completed more than a dozen small projects related to CAN data processing, configuration/programming, diagnostics, etc. Rather than providing detailed explanations of them all, I've listed a few below:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Analyzing CAN diagnostics on a Ford Mustang Mach-E to determine power inefficiency at high RPM's.</li>
                                <li>Localized C# command line tool for developers to easily flash firmware, send NVM configuration values, or request individual values (for testing) over the CAN bus.</li>
                                <li><a href="https://python-can.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">Python-CAN</a> device firmware update (DFU) script for testing & validating the DFU process I designed.</li>
                                <li>C# <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide" target="_blank">Universal Windows Platform (UWP)</a> to handle the testing & production process of one of our projects: a sound generator for electric cars. It loaded code, wrote config, tested/validated values, etc.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </main>
